- Use the LeadPulse color palette for all UI elements:
  - Marigold (#E89C31): Primary buttons (e.g., "Verify Lead"), CTAs.
  - Muted Sky Blue (#A9C7D5): Data visualizations (charts, filters).
  - Soft Fern (#92A680): Integration toggles, campaign triggers.
  - Peony Pink (#F291A2): Notifications, A/B testing toggles.
  - Warm Ivory (#F8EDE3): Dashboard backgrounds.
  - Goldenrod (#F2C94C): Geolocation pins, mobile highlights.
  - Bright White (#FEFEFE): Pricing cards, text on dark backgrounds.
- Apply Magic UI components for dynamic effects:
  - Glowing Button: For Marigold buttons (e.g., `<button className="magic-glow bg-marigold">Verify Lead</button>`).
  - Animated Number: For lead scores in Muted Sky Blue (e.g., `<AnimatedNumber value={score} style={{ color: '#A9C7D5' }} />`).
  - 3D Card Tilt: For dashboard widgets on Warm Ivory.
  - Confetti Burst: For Peony Pink success alerts.
- Use Tailwind CSS classes for styling (e.g., `bg-marigold text-bright-white`).
- Ensure WCAG 2.1 contrast ratios (e.g., 4.5:1 for Marigold on Warm Ivory).
- Test UI responsiveness on mobile (e.g., Goldenrod pins on maps).
